- Define the list of molecules used
- Read in the parameters for a spectrum from a file. Each line is 1 set of parameters
- Create a convolver object for each of the different possible settings
- For each set of parameters, generate a slab model
    - Create a Molecule object for each of the molecules at a given temperature
        - Save parameters of the molecule
        - Determine molar weight of the molecule (Done with a library)
    - Get data from a given molecule object
        - Use a library to read in a hitran file given certain parameters
        - Extract certain columns from the read data
    - For each of the wavelength channels, generate a slab model spectrum
        - Use a prodimopy 0D slab model given the parameters, including a wavelength range. Create spectrum over the total wavelength range
    - Convolve according to the right convolver. Different wavelength ranges have different resolving powers thus have to be handled separately. It is done using library methods
        - Slide over the spectrum and take slices based on the wavelengths specified in the convolver
        - Convolve each slice separately
        - Concatenate the slices back together. Convolver already handles overlap
    - Sum the intensities of the spectra for each molecule
- Save each spectrum in an efficient way to a file
