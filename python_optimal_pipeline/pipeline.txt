Phase 1: precomputations
We create some objects that will have to be reused many times and will be the same
Can be multiprocessed: No
- Generate a convolver object for each type of setting present/possible
- For each molecule modelled, calculate the molar weight 
- For each molecule modelled, read the hitran file over the entire wavelength range     // Not necessary since this already happens in the slab generation and I will not remake that
- Read the parameters for which the slab models need to be generated, each line being one set of parameters

Phase 2: slab model piece generations
We create collections of slab models that are unconvolved and uncombined and save their locations together for a single slab model
Can be multiprocessed: yes (use a semaphore, make sure slabs aren't created double)
- Load the current parameters into memory
- For each of the combinations of number density,temperature for each molecule, check if the slab is already generated
- If not, generate the slab for that combination and save it to a file. Save filepath to list
- If yes, save the filepath to where it is saved
- Move on till all the parameters are read

Phase 3: Convolved piece generator
We convolve single molecule slabs given a setting and save that as a new building block
Can be multiprocessed: yes, we could either multiprocess within a collection or between collections
- Take a created collection from phase 2
- Load the convolver corresponding to the right setting(s) into memory
- Loop through the different slab files
- Check if this combination of file + convolver has already been made
- If not, convolve the slab and save it as a new file. Save filepath to list + setting
- If yes, retrieve the filepath where it is stored and save it to a new collection
- Repeat for all collections from phase 2


Due to the fact objects are created with generating slab models, we have to combine phase 2 and 3, increasing the number of computations, so we get the following phase
Phase 2,3: Total piece generator
Can be multiprocessed: yes
- Look at a set of parameters
- Create a new set of parameters for (molecule, temperature, column_density, convolver_settings)
- Check if item is already generated, else generate the slab
    - For each wavelengthrange /* 1 channel */ based on the convolver, generate a slab
    - For each molecule, concatenate the different wavelength windows, resulting in a spectrum for (molecule, temperature, column_density, convolver_settings)


Phase 4: Combine pieces
Combine the convolved pieces into single spectra and apply final processes to spectrum
Can be multiprocessed: yes, each spectrum can be handled separately
- Load a collection from phase 3
- Load all the spectra from the filenames
- Add the intensities together for all the molecules (Wavelengths are the same since same convolver is used)
- Normalize the spectrum to 1 (Not relevant for data generation but makes it easier later on to process)
- Save the wavelengths, intensities and used number densities in some data-efficient format that does not lose information
- Repeat for all collections

Phase 5: Cleanup
Make sure no unnecessary storage is used
Can be multiprocessed: No
- Remove all the files from the convolved pieces
- Remove all files from unconvolved pieces
- Free all dynamically allocated memory
